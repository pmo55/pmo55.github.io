It has taken me some time to get from my first project to my second.  In between that time, I had a second child and got a promotion at my current job.  But after things settled down, I got back to working on the learn platform, specifically the Sinatra section.  

I am a tech/gadget lover of all sorts.  I love all of it and have a bit of a passion for it.  I decided, for my sinatra project, to create a basic "Gadget Review website" where readers can view all of the reviews posted to the website.  If the reader is inclined, they can even register as a reviewer and begin posting their own gadget reviews.  The reviewer would list the product name, write a review, and even give it a rating.  In the process of writing this simple web app, I developed validations that would prevent the reviewer from submitting bad data(like blank fields, or a rating that was not within the parameters).  I also set up warning messages throughout the application using the rack-flash gem, which was as simple as it gets. All the meanwhile, I went through each requirement for the project and made sure my application would meet those requirements. 


I am not gonna lie, I lacked some confidence going into this project, largly because of the significant gap in accessing the learn platform(while life events ensued).  But as I got going and moving on this project, I got more and more confident I would be able to meet the requirements and  eventually succeed.  I look forward to spending more time on the platform and completing more assignments.  2 Projects down and 3 more to go.
