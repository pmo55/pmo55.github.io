Why programming?  Well, the interest in "programming" began when I was 12 years old.  I had lived on a ranch at that time with my father and brothers.  While my father and brothers would go off riding trails on their horses, I sat at home running a developer version of AOL, without a clue as to what it truly did.  One day, one of my father's friends came over and mentioned to me that he worked on a big program for windows. I began to ask him questions about how it all works.   It was the moment the interest went from an ember to a spark that had never left me.  Although programming had not become a priority in my life, that spark remained over the years.  Fast forward to now, I work full time for a great company, making a decent and comfortable enough living but I want more.  I decided its time to pursue that spark and turn it into a flame.  I am a man of few words, but my ambitions are big.
